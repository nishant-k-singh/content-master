Content Master is a content aggregator that collects content from different sources, organizes them and puts them in one place for consumption.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

**Content Master** requires [ **Python (> Python 3.6)**](https://www.python.org/) .

### Getting the project.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/gdsoumya/content_master.git
or 
Download and extract the Zip-File
```
### Setting up Virtual Environemt
Setting up a virtual environment would be better for both development and normal execution purposes.
```sh
$ cd content_master
$ python -m virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
 or (Windows machine)
$ .\env\Scripts\activate
```
### Installing Dependencies
The Project has a few dependencies which can be installed by running.
```sh
$ pip install -r dependencies.txt 
```
## Starting the Server
To start the Flask server run
```sh
$ python server.py
```
A Flask development server will be initialized at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

### Warnings 
A possible warning that one might get is :

**WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.**

This warning is displayed because currently a Flask Development Server is running but the default environment of Flask is set to Production, to remove this warning change the FLASK_ENV environment variable.
<br>***Setting environment to development automatically sets the debugger on.**
```sh
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
or (Windows machine)
$ set FLASK_ENV=development
```

## Errors and Debugging options
The server by default does not start in debugger mode but to initialize debugger mode change the last line of the '[server.py](https://github.com/gdsoumya/content_master/blob/master/server.py)' file to :
```python
app.run() -> app.run(debug=True)
```
Most errors will be logged to the console and can be referenced later for debugging.
